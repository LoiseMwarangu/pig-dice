    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>You will roll a six sided die.The main objective of this game is to be the first player to reach 100 points.Try hard not to roll a one since this means that you loose your current score </p>
    <br />
    <h2>General Rules</h2>
      <p>
          In each turn a player rolls a die repeatedly until either a 1 is rolled or player decides to hold and pass on the turn to its opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
          The number player rolls is added to a interim score. If the player rolls a 1, they lose their interim score and turn is passed to their opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
          If player gets any other number, they can decide to continue and roll the die.
      </p>
      <p>
          If player decides to hold, then their turn total (interim score) is added to the overall score.
      </p>
      <p>
          The first player to score 100 points wins the game.
